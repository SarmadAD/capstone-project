## About The Project
### This is my capstone project for the web development bootcamp of [neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de/)
With my time history you can create a timeline in which you add your experiences for example from the last vacation üèù , most important moments or just everyday things. 
You can then share your timeline with other people.
